## Usage
### Light metering
* In the top row you will see a camera preview and can adjust the ISO and ND values.
* The aperture and shutter speed pairs are displayed in the center after a measurement has been taken.
* The bottom contains the button for measuring, a button to switch between front and back lenses and a settings button.

### Organizing preview shots
* *Still needs to be developed*
